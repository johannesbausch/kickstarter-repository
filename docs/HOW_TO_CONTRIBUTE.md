# 3. Set Up the Upstream Remote

To keep your fork up to date with the original repository, you need to add an "upstream" remote.

1. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```shell
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/johannesbausch/repository-kickstarter.git
   ```
2. Verify that the upstream remote has been added:
   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

# 4. Create a New Branch

To keep your changes organized and distinct from the main codebase, create a new branch.

1. First, ensure you're on the main branch:
   ```shell
   git checkout main
   ```
2. Generate a new branch and switch to it using the following command:
   ```shell
   git checkout -b feature/your-desired-feature
   ```

You‚Äôre now ready to modify the code. Open the project in your preferred code editor, make the necessary changes, and save your work.

# 6. Commit Your Changes

Once you‚Äôve made your changes, it‚Äôs time to commit them to your branch.

1. To see which files have been modified, run:
   ```shell
   git status
   ```
2. Stage your changes:
   ```shell
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit your changes along with a clear and descriptive message:
   ```shell
   git commit -m "Added something"
   ```

# 7. Push Your Branch to GitHub

Upload your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
```shell
git push origin feature/your-desired-feature
```

# 8. Open a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed to your fork, it's time to create a pull request (PR) to the original repository.

1. Visit the [original repository](https://github.com/johannesbausch/kicksterter-repository) on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
3. Review your changes to make sure everything is correct.

# 9. Respond to Review Feedback

After submitting your pull request, a code style check will run automatically, and the repository maintainers may review your code and request changes.

If any changes are requested, update your branch locally, commit the changes, and push them to your fork. The pull request will automatically reflect the latest updates.

# 10. Keep Your Fork Up-to-Date

To keep your fork synchronized with the original repository, make sure to regularly update it.

1. Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository by running:
   ```shell
   git fetch upstream
   ```
2. Merge the upstream changes into your local main branch using the following command:
   ```shell
   git checkout main
   ```

   ```shell
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

3. Push the updated main branch to your fork:
   ```shell
   git push origin main
   ```
